        <h1>Is Artificial Food Coloring Bad for You</h1>
        <p>This is something that you probably have not given thought to. The only advantage of the food color is to make the food look more appetizing.</p>
        <h1>THE DISADVANTAGES OF SYNTHETIC FOOD COLORING SEEM TO OUTWEIGH THE ADVANTAGES</h1>
        <p>
            <li>Many countries warn by writing special instructions on the color so that it can be used wisely</li>.<li> For example, In Europe, a few dyes (yellow 5, yellow 6) have a warning text- ‘may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children’.</li><li> These are related to allergic reactions. </li><li> in India, there are no such warning signals on food dyes to avoid.</li>
               <li> They are carcinogenic and can cause cancer as some artificial food colors are also associated with the production of carcinogenic compounds while getting metabolized.</li>
              <li>  Yellow 3 has been linked with a few allergies (especially those who are sensitive to ‘aspirin’).</li>
        </p>
        <h1>Go Natural.</h1>
        <p>Processed food is mostly equipped with artificial food dyes which provides us with one more reason to avoid them. As already stated, these synthetic dyes affect children to a great extent, so if your children are having aggression issues, it is time to eliminate them from their diet. Also, check the content and make sure, if you ever buy any synthetic dye, it is a permissible one.

            Hence, Go Natural!!! Natural colorants are extracted from natural herbs and plant parts. For example, kokum, beetroot, and safflower form a very large source of natural coloring agents. Enhance the nutrition in the food as well as its color by using a natural color.</p>
